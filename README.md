# geo4web-testbed - general repository
The general repository is used to publish meeting minutes and other general stuff.

## the testbed
Geonovum wants to know more about how to publish spatial data on the web in a usable manner. To this end we are running a testbed around these four research topics, three of which are already done:
*	Research topic #1: Modern ways of spatial data publication (not yet carried out)
*	Research topic #2: A usable spatial data publication platform
  * [Report][1] describing the results
  * [Repository][2] 
*	Research topic #3: Crawlable spatial data using the ecosystem of the Web and Linked Data
  *	[Report][3] describing the results
  * [Repository][4] 
  * Data: [Land cover][14] and [Administrative areas][15]
*	Research topic #4: Spatial data on the web using the current SDI
  *	[Report][5] describing the results
  * [Repository with slides/documents][6] 
  * [Other repositories][7] 
* Research topic #5: A prototype based on the lessons learned (not yet carried out)
